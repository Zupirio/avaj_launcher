# avaj_launcher

My first WeThinkCode_ java project that aims to make a flight simulator.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. If you don't follow this [link](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)

### Prerequisites

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favorite IDE/terminal

```
```

### Installing

Clone this project to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/Zupirio/avaj_launcher.git
```

Move to the sh file in src and run the script.

```
cd avaj_launcher/avaj-launcher/src && sh run.sh
```

## Running the tests

First compile the project

```
java simulator.Simulation scenario.txt
```

Output will be in the simulation.txt

```
cat simulation.txt

```

### And coding style tests

When you run this project, you'll see that the output is of every vehicle. In the scenario.txt file, the first line states how many times the simulation is going to run.
The first column is the type of vehicle, second is the address, third is longitude of the vehicle while the fourth and fifth state the latitude and height respectively.
You are allowed to play around with the longitude, latitude and height figures to have a different output.
